/**
 * Two alarm buzzers are located on the buzzer PCBA. The buzzer PCBA is capable 
 * of producing 65 - 80 dBA alarm tones based on the alarm priority. 
 * A 4.8 V Ni-MH battery is mounted on the buzzer PCBA to power the ventilatorâ€™s 
 * POWER SUPPLY LOSS alarm. The battery is charged to a maximum voltage of 5.6 V. 
 * At this point the charger switches to a trickle-charge mode which maintains 
 * the battery voltage.
