# Contributor Code of Conduct

## 1. Pupose

The primary goal of the Open Ventilator Project is to produce an open source 
ventilator to assist medical professionals treating Covid-19 patients.  This 
code and any contributions you may make may be used in such a medical device,
where a person's life may depend on the quality of the code.  As a result, this
Code of Conduct sets forth requirements in order to participate, and how you
should contribute.

While other open source projects adopt Contributor Code of Conduct policies
encouraging the highest virtues and tolerance, we really don't care where you are
from, what you look like, or how you choose to interact with the world.

## 2. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an 
individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing 
a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting 
via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative 
at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined 
and clarified by project maintainers.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all contributors:

- Contributors must be professional in their communications with others
- All pull requests will be code reviewed
- Code must be properly documented
- Unit tests must be written where necessary 

## 4. Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject 
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not 
aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any 
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, 
or harmful.

## 5. Copyrights and Licensing

You must not submit any code or contribution that is copyrighted without the copyright
holder's expressed permission, and they must agree that that contribution becomes owned
by RxJet Incorporated and bound by the terms of the GPL license.  

## 6. Weapons Policy

Concealed weapons will be allowed at Open Ventilator events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered 
by the scope of this Code of Conduct, provided the person carrying the weapon is licensed to
do so.  Community members are further expected to comply with all state
and local laws on this matter.
