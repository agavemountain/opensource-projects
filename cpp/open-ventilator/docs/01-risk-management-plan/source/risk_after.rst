Risk management After software development
===========================================

This chapter covers the risk management process and organization during the software development.

Organization and Responsibilities

Describe the organization of the team responsible for risk management during design. 
You may add an organization chart or add a reference to your project management plan, 
where the organization of the project should be already described.

Qualification of Personnel
--------------------------

Describe the qualification of personnel responsible for the risk management and risk analysis activities. Example:
The personnel who participates to the risk analysis is composed of:
-	Experienced staff who was involved in the design process of similar products
-	The expert praticians who participate to the design process

Production and maintenance information
--------------------------------------

The Risk Management File is systematically reviewed and updated in the maintenance of the device, especially when:
-	The product is modified (software patch, minor updates),
-	Analysis of data of post marketing surveillance triggers a reevaluation (internal defects, customer requests, maintenance, vigilance bulletins, of field information from any source),

Annual Audit
------------
Reviews and updates to the Risk Management File will be done 
annually (choose your periodicity) 
Reviews and updates to any risk related document will be documented, 
approved, and included within the Risk Management File.
