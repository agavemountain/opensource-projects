Ranking System for Risk Analysis
================================

This section describes how the risk priority number is deduced from the characteristics of the risk:
•	List the criteria defined in §2.2.

Describe in sub sections how you quantify your criteria, like these:

Probability of Occurrence
-------------------------
Use quantitative criteria. Here is an example.

Ranking	Definition 	Frequency (F)
5	Every month	Frequent (very high probability)
4	Once every year	Probable (high probability)
3	Once in last 5 years	Occasional (moderate probability)
2	Once in last 10 years	Unlikely (low probability)
1	Zero occurrence in the past 10 years with similar products	Very Unlikely (very low probability)

Consequences of Hazard
----------------------
Use criteria based on damages on patient and/or user

Ranking	Definition	Clinical and Process End Effects
5	Catastrophic	Serious injury (irreversible) or death of the patient or user
4	Critical	Serious injury (reversible) to the patient or user. New treatment required.
3	Moderate	Moderate injury to the patient or user. Longer treatment time or new minor treatment required.
2	Minor	Minor injury to the patient. Longer treatment time
1	Negligible / Cosmetic	No injury to the patient or user.

Add your other criteria
-----------------------
Your definition

Determination of risk priority number
-------------------------------------
A rule of your choice, like.
Risk priority number = 	criterion 1
	x criterion 2
	…
	x criterion n
