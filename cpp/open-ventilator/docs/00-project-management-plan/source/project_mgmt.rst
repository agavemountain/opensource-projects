tools, simulators, etc., they shall be identified, and referenced here.

Relationships with project stakeholders
---------------------------------------

Customer or end-user involvement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Customer/end-user involvment will be limited until a viable product is developed.  In 
the last stages, end-users will be engaged to refine the product.

Subcontractor Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the early phases of this project, there will not be any subcontractor involvement.
In later phases, relationships will be established with contract manufacturing 
sites which will be managed with industry standard statements of work, reviews, 
assembly procedures, test procedures, etc.

Relationships with other teams
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Currently there are no other teams.  This will change if others start contributing to
the project.

Communication
-------------

Meetings
^^^^^^^^
Meetings may be held in person or online.  When possible, and if there are any decisions 
or discussions of importance to the project, meeting minutes should be recorded and 
saved and appended into either github or as a document in the git repository.

Reviews
^^^^^^^
- Code reviews will take place with every pull request.
- Hardware design reviews will take place during the hardware design phase.
- Test reviews will take place at the appropriate times.
