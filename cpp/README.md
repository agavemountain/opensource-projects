# C/C++ 

**Context: [main](../README.md) / cpp **

This directory contains various projects.

+ **[cy14b101na linux driver](lnx-drv-cy14b101na/)**: simple memory mapped device driver
+ **[xcdb](xcdb/)**: b-tree database management system from scratch
+ **[open-ventilator](open-ventilator/)** Project to write firmware for an open ventilator, based on Medtronic's release of older.  The project was unworkable since the 
many parts in the schematic were no longer manufacturered, and FDA requirements.
