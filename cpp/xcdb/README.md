# xcdb
Simple C database library with b-tree indexes, from scratch.

This code is based on the code listed in Al Stevens's book
entitled, "C Database Development," pubished in 1990.  Much of
the code predated but was upgraded to ANSI C.  This was a 
magical time before unit tests, singletons, and other modern
practices.  You have been warned.
