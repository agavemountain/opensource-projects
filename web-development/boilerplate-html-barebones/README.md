** STATUS: DEPRECATED, DON'T USE.  This uses cruise control as the build platform **

If you've stumbled on this project by accident, you are probabaly looking for the "right" way to build a web application.  Unfortunately for you, there is not "right" way.

This is a simple, barebones project designed to get a _simple web_ project off the ground as little friction as possible.  

I simply got tired of reinventing the wheel every time a client wanted me to throw together a website.

More specifically, this project contains a few rudimentary files and can build a compressed tarball for distribution, of a simple, static website.  

Directory Structure
---
I've been involed with quite a few large web projects, and see very little in the way to standardized structure..  Most follow something simular to this directories project:

    build/   - build and configuration files
    source/  - web accessable files, javascript, etc.
      css/   - cascading style sheets
      img/   - images
      js/    - javascript
    tools/   - third party tools and utilities. 
    release/ - directory where the build will be output to.
