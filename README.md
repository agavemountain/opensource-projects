# opensource-projects
A monorepo of all of my hardware and software examples and small prjoects. 
My github repositories have grown in numbers, so I've decided to organize
the smallest projects into this mono repository and delete all of the 
individual repositories.

** Be warned, some of these never made it to completion, or are fun little
side projects that I might poke at from time to time but will never become
a fully release stand-alone product. **

The following individual git repositories have been merged here.

## [Docker Examples](docker-examples/README.md) 

+ **[cowsay](docker-examples/cowsay/)**: Simplest docker example ever.

## [Ansible playbooks](ansible/README.md)

## [Web development](web-development/README.md)

+ **[boilerplate-html-barebones](web-development/boilerplate-html-barebones/)**: index.html with cruisecontrol build script.

## [C/C++](cpp/README.md)

+ **[cy14b101na linux driver](cpp/lnx-drv-cy14b101na/)**: simple memory mapped device driver
+ **[xcdb](cpp/xcdb/)**: b-tree database management system from scratch
