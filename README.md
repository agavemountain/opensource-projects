# opensource-projects
A monorepo of all of my hardware and software examples and small prjoects. 
My github repositories have grown in numbers, so I've decided to organize
the smallest projects into this mono repository and delete all of the 
individual repositories.

## [Docker Examples](docker-examples/README.md) 

+ **[cowsay](docker-examples/cowsay/)**: Simplest docker example ever.

## [Ansible playbooks](ansible/README.md)
