# Minnesota Hiking Trails

## Hiking Clubs, Passport Clubs and Challenges

The Minnesota DNR has two programs to encourage visitors to state parks: 

- the Hiking Club; and 
- the Passport Club.

Additionally, the North Country Trail Association has an annual Hike 100 Challenge.

### Hiking Club

The Hiking Club will take you to 68 trails at state parks and recreation areas throughout Minnesota.  You purchase a log book
($14.95 plus tax) at any state park.  Passwords are posted on trails.  Once you have written down enough passwords you can
get a patch or free camping.  Patches/stickers are awarded every 25 miles up to 175 miles.

### Passport Club
With the Passport Club ($14.95 plus tax) you receive a passport (and a travel lournal/logbook), where you collect stamps from each of the state parks.  Rewards:

- A pin and certificate for a free night of camping at 25 stamps.
- A certificate for free night of camping when you collect all of the stamps.

### North Country Trail Hike 100

Hike [100 miles on the North Country Trail](https://northcountrytrail.org/hike-100-challenge/) and receive a commemorative patch and certificate of completion.
